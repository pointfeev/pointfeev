|| Main Projects |
|-|-|
| [CreamInstaller](https://github.com/pointfeev/CreamInstaller) | Automatically finds all installed Steam, Epic and Ubisoft games with their respective DLC-related DLL locations on the user's computer, parses SteamCMD, Steam Store and Epic Games Store for user-selected games' DLCs, then provides a very simple graphical interface utilizing the gathered information for the maintenance of DLC unlockers. |

|| Mods: [RimWorld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100) |
|-|-|
| [Pawns Use Fire Extinguishers](https://github.com/pointfeev/FireExtinguisher) | Allows fire extinguishers to be used for firefighting automatically. If a pawn doesn't have a fire extinguisher or a piece of fire can't be accessed with a fire extinguisher, pawns will go back to default vanilla behavior of beating out fires. |
| [Advanced Storage Filters](https://github.com/pointfeev/StorageFilters) | Adds the ability to add extra advanced and configurable filters to storage areas. It also allows filters to be saved and loaded between multiple saves. |
| [Automatic Bed Reassignment](https://github.com/pointfeev/BedAssign) | Automatically reassigns pawns' beds when pawns are off-map, sharing beds with non-partners, separated from their most-loved partner, suffering a mood penalty from a bedroom-specific trait (jealous, greedy, ascetic), or there are empty beds with better stats for the pawn. |
